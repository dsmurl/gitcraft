# Workspace root .env.example
# Copy this file to `.env` at the repository root.
# This acts as the single source of truth for shared environment variables, including database credentials.

# Database configuration: choose ONE of the options below.

# Option A: Turso (libsql over HTTPS)
# Example URL format: libsql://your-db-name-username.turso.io
TURSO_DATABASE_URL=
TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN=

# Option B: Local SQLite (dev only)
# Prefer an absolute path to avoid CWD issues when running Nx targets from different packages.
# Example (absolute): /absolute/path/to/libs/drizzle/local.sqlite
# Example (relative to libs/drizzle, only if you know your tooling resolves from there): ./local.sqlite
SQLITE_FILE=

# Optional: Separate credentials for migrations if you want to run migrations against a different DB.
# If you choose to use these, adjust your tooling/config to read MIGRATIONS_* first and fallback to TURSO_*.
